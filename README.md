# AI Image Authenticity Detector

Python · Computer Vision · Machine Learning · AICTE Internship Project

---

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements an AI image detection system that determines whether an uploaded image is real or AI-generated. The system analyzes image patterns using frequency domain analysis and pixel-level feature extraction to make predictions.

The system provides instant classification along with visual graphs explaining the decision process. It is designed as a lightweight real-time detection system that runs without heavy model training.
